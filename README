This project is a demonstration of how to use NodeJS and CraftJS to make a MMORPG game.
NodeJS take cares of all server operations, including connect, disconect, broadcast and etc.
Crafty is used as an engine to prepare the game part. We are talking about sprites, maps, actions, components and entities.
This example is so simple, it considers a user that input your name and generate a hero entity in our map.

A preload is used to load all sprite information. In this case we only using images, but it could be sounds too.

In order to test, just execute the following in your console:

>> node app.js

There are still things missing in this examples.

1st problem - NPCs can move, but cant animate themselves.

I create a function to create NPCs representing another players, but my gap is when i have to attach a enterframe event to this NPC Entity. When i do it, the enterframe cannot gather the HeroInformation from server and decides to which side it will animate.
Test by yourself with 2 clients and you will understand.
